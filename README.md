Outliers 

Z-scores(threshold) are the number of standard deviations above and below the mean that each value falls. For example, a Z-score of 2 indicates that an observation is two standard deviations above the average while a Z-score of -2 signifies it is two standard deviations below the mean.For our code , we have selected 3 as Z-score so anything obove it will be considered as an outlier.

This package has been created based on Project 2 of course UCS633.
